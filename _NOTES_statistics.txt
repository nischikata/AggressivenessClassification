" well, like I said, F is the test statistic and is equal to:
F=variance of the group means / mean of the within group variances
the p-value on the other hand, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.
p value is a probability, F is a value of a test...2 different things. "

" Another general statement: scores are better if greater, p-values are better if smaller (and losses are better if smaller) "
